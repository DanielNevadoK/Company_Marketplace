## **ðŸ’¬ Comments**  
This was a fun project to work on, and I enjoyed the **5-day deadline**. Most of the tools used to build this full-stack app were new to me. I was already familiar with **React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Fetch API**, and **deploying a website**, but everything else was a **first-time experience**.  

It has been a **great learning opportunity** and has motivated me to explore these **methods** further for future projects. This project has also **ignited a couple of ideas** that I plan to pursue in the future.
